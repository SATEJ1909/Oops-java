✅ Class in Java
A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.

It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of objects.

It does not allocate memory until an object is created.

Syntax:
class ClassName { // fields and methods }

✅ Object in Java
An object is an instance of a class.

It is created using the new keyword.

Objects have state (data) and behavior (methods).

Example: Student s = new Student();

✅ Key Concepts
Encapsulation

Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit.

Achieved using private fields and public getter/setter methods.

Provides data hiding.

Constructor

A special method that is called when an object is created.

It initializes the object.

Has the same name as the class and no return type.

this Keyword

Refers to the current object.

Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters.

Access Modifiers

Control visibility of class members.

public: accessible from anywhere

private: accessible only within the class

protected: accessible within package and subclasses

default (no keyword): package-private

Static Keyword

Belongs to the class rather than instances.

Shared among all objects of the class.

Used for constants, utility methods, or shared counters.

✅ Object-Oriented Principles Related to Class & Object
Abstraction: Hiding internal implementation and showing only functionality.

Inheritance: One class acquires properties of another class.

Polymorphism: Same method behaves differently based on the object.
