ðŸ”¹ 1. Aggregation â€“ "Has-a" (Weak Association)
Definition:
Aggregation is a form of association that represents a "has-a" relationship between two classes, where the child (contained object) can exist independently of the parent.

Key Points:

It is a loose coupling between two classes.

It allows code reusability.

If the container object is destroyed, the contained object can still exist.

Example: A University has-a Professor. Even if the University is closed, Professors can exist.

Code Example:

java
Copy
Edit
class Professor {
    String name;
    Professor(String name) { this.name = name; }
}

class University {
    String name;
    Professor professor;  // Aggregation

    University(String name, Professor professor) {
        this.name = name;
        this.professor = professor;
    }
}
UML Notation: Open diamond (â—Š)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Composition â€“ "Has-a" (Strong Association)
Definition:
Composition is a stricter form of aggregation where the contained object cannot exist without the container. It implies ownership, meaning one object is completely dependent on the other.

Key Points:

It is a strong coupling between classes.

The lifecycle of the contained object depends on the container.

If the container is destroyed, the contained object is also destroyed.

Example: A House has-a Room. If the House is destroyed, the Room doesnâ€™t exist.

Code Example:

java
Copy
Edit
class Room {
    String type;
    Room(String type) { this.type = type; }
}

class House {
    private Room room;  // Composition

    House() {
        this.room = new Room("Bedroom"); // Room created inside House
    }
}
UML Notation: Filled diamond (â—†)

ðŸ”¸ 3. Key Differences: Aggregation vs Composition
Feature	Aggregation	Composition
Relationship Type	Has-a (weak)	Has-a (strong)
Dependency	Independent	Dependent
Object Lifetime	Child object lives independently	Child object dies with parent
Coupling	Loose	Tight
UML Symbol	Open Diamond (â—Š)	Filled Diamond (â—†)
Example	Department has Teachers	House has Rooms

ðŸ”¸ 4. Real-world Analogies
Scenario	Aggregation	Composition
Library System	Library has Books (books can exist elsewhere)	Library Catalog Entry (can't exist without a book)
Car	Car has Driver (driver exists independently)	Car has Engine (engine belongs only to car)

ðŸ”¸ 5. When to Use What?
Use Aggregation When:	Use Composition When:
Objects can exist independently	Objects are part of a whole
You want reusability and flexibility	You want exclusive ownership
Lifetime of part is not bound to whole	Lifetime of part is bound to whole

ðŸ”¸ 6. Common Interview Questions
Q: What is the difference between Aggregation and Composition?
A: Aggregation is a weak association where the part can exist independently of the whole. Composition is a strong association where the part cannot exist without the whole.

Q: Can you give real-world examples of both?
A: Aggregation â†’ Student and College
Composition â†’ Heart and Human

Q: Which one promotes more reusability?
A: Aggregation promotes more reusability as objects are independent.
